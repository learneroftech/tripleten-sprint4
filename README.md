# tripleten-sprint4
This is the repo for the Final Project of Sprint 4 in the TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Overview
This project includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis of the vehicles dataset.  
It also features an interactive tool that allows users to simulate random events related to vehicle pricing and conditions, helping to understand variability and uncertainty in the data.

### Files
- `notebooks/EDA.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing data exploration and visualizations

### Analysis Includes
- Basic dataset overview and summary statistics
- Missing value analysis
- Interactive visualizations using plotly-express:
  - Vehicle price distribution histogram
  - Model year distribution by condition histogram
  - Price vs odometer reading scatterplot
  - Price vs model year by condition scatterplot

### Methods and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x  
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build an interactive web app with UI components such as headers and checkboxes  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data loading and manipulation  
- [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) for creating interactive visualizations
